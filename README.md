Reflection on your experience with this assignment: 
I think this is the hardest assignment. I understand how recursion works and how to trace it, but I find it difficult to implement it and program it. After going to office hours and consulting with Daniel Justo, I was able to get the program to run and solve the maze. I think I spent more time understanding and figuring out how the recursion will work than actual programming. It was interesting to see GUI and backend programming work together to make the maze work.
